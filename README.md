## About Me

I am an independent mechanistic interpretability researcher currently working on circuit discovery with sparse autoencoders.

## Work Showcase
[`sparse_circuit_discovery`](https://github.com/DavidUdell/sparse_circuit_discovery) is a clean PyTorch reimplementation, for GPT-2-small, of the [Marks et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19647) unsupervised circuit discovery algorithm. It also contains a simpler "naive ablations" algorithm for circuit discovery; some results from the ablations algorithm are [presented here.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uNGAjA8wCNDZHJxu8/causal-graphs-of-gpt-2-small-s-residual-stream)
